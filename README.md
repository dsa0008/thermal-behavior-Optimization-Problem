# thermal-behavior-Optimization-Problem

This repository centers on the estimation of thermal behavior in electronics interconnects, utilizing real-world data incorporating material properties, environmental factors, and physical attributes. The project employs numerical methods to formulate an analytical model, followed by an optimization stage that refines parameters based solely on physical properties. The optimization process is driven by Particle Swarm Optimization.
